* Game Play Loop
  * This is a roguelike game where the player needs to sacrifice themself in order to open up more of the map for future runs. The idea is that it's a rapid loop of death leading to progression. 
* Game Mechanics
  * The player will be able to move around the map, interact with levers or pressure plates, and trigger traps. Given this is a gamejam, there will be no combat. Instead it's going to be more of a puzzle roguelike, diving deeper into the dungeon to unlock treaures that will provide new mechanics for future generations.

The name On The Shoulders is a reference to the quote "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
by Isaac Newton. The idea is that the player will be able to unlock new mechanics
that will allow them to progress further in the dungeon with each run.
